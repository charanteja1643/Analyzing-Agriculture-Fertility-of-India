🌾 Agricultural Fertility in India – Power BI Dashboard

This repository contains a self-developed Power BI project that provides a comprehensive analysis of agricultural fertility across different states of India. The dashboard presents insights into crop yields, soil health, irrigation practices, and fertilizer usage—empowering viewers to better understand regional disparities and trends in agricultural productivity.

📊 Project Overview

This project was created using personal research, domain understanding, and data analytics skills without reliance on external templates. The dashboard is designed to help:

Identify high and low fertility regions
Understand correlations between soil quality, irrigation, and crop yields
Analyze temporal trends in agricultural output
Support data-driven policy and planning decisions
📁 Features

State-wise Fertility Mapping
Soil Health Indicators (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels)
Crop Yield Trends (major crops over the years)
Fertilizer Usage Analysis
Interactive Visuals and Drill-down Reports
🧠 Built With

Power BI Desktop (for dashboard creation and data modeling)
MS Excel / CSV Files (as data sources)
DAX and Power Query (for calculations and data transformation)
📈 Dataset

The data was manually collected and cleaned from publicly available government sources such as:

Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, India
ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research)
State Agriculture Reports
💡 Key Insights

Fertility is highest in states with balanced irrigation and sustainable fertilizer use.
Overuse of chemical fertilizers correlates with declining soil health in certain regions.
Crop yield improvements are closely tied to soil pH balance and modern irrigation methods.
